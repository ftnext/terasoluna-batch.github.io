<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term of "Batch Processing" refers to the execution or process of a series of jobs in a computer program without manual intervention (non-interactive).<br>
It is often a process of reading, processing and writing a large number of records from a database or a file.<br>
Batch processing consists of following features and is a processing method which prioritizes process throughput than the responsiveness, as compared to online processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Commons of batch processing</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Process large number of data is collected and processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uninterruptible process for certainty of time is done in a fixed sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process runs in accordance with the schedule.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objective of batch processing is given below.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Enhanced throughput</dt>
<dd>
<p>Process throughput can be enhanced by processing the data sets collectively in a batch.<br>
File or database does not input or output data one by one, and instead sums up data of a fixed quantity thus dramatically reducing overheads of waiting for I/O resulting in the increased efficiency.
Even though waiting period for I/O of a single record is insignificant, cumulative accumulation while processing a large amount of data result in fatal delay.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Ensuring responsiveness</dt>
<dd>
<p>Processes which are not required to be processed immediately are cut for batch processing in order to ensure responsiveness of online processing.<br>
For example, when the process results are not required immediately, the processing is done by online processing till its acceptance and batch processing is performed in the background.
The processing method is generally called "delayed processing".</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Response to time and events</dt>
<dd>
<p>Processes corresponding to specific period and events are naturally implemented by batch processing.<br>
For example, aggregating business data sets per month on the next 1st weekend,<br>
taking backup every Sunday at 2a.m in accordance with the system operation rules,<br>
and so on.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Restriction for coordination with external system</dt>
<dd>
<p>Batch processing is also used due to restrictions of interface like files with interactions of external systems.<br>
File sent from the external system is a summary of data collected for a certain period.
Batch processing is better suited for the processes which incorporate these files, than the online processing.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is very common to combine various techniques to achieve batch processing. Major techniques are introduced here.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Job Scheduler</dt>
<dd>
<p>A single execution unit of a batch processing is called a job. A job scheduler is a middleware to manage this job.<br>
A batch system rarely has several jobs, and usually the number of jobs can reach hundreds or even thousands at times.
Hence, an exclusive system to define the relation with the job and manage execution schedule becomes indispensable.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Shell script</dt>
<dd>
<p>One of the methods to implement a job. A process is achieved by combining the commands implemented in OS and middleware.<br>
Although the method can be implemented easily, it is not suitable for writing complex business logic. Hence, it is primarily used in simple processes like copying a file, backup, clearing a table etc.
Further, shell script performs only the pre-start settings and post-execution processing while executing a process implemented in another programming language.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Programming language</dt>
<dd>
<p>One of the methods to implement a job. Structured code can be written rather than the shell script and is advantageous for securing development productivity, maintainability and quality.
Hence, it is commonly used to implement business logic that processes data of file or database which tend to be relatively complex with logic.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">A large amount of data can be efficiently processed using certain resources (Performance improvement)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Processing time is reduced by processing the data collectively. Important part here is <strong>"Certain resources"</strong> part.<br>
Processing can be done by using a CPU and memory for 100 or even 1 million records and the processing time is ideally extended slowly and linearly according to number of records.
Transaction is started and terminated for certain number of records to perform a process collectively. Resources to be  used must be levelled in order to perform I/O collectively.<br>
Still, when a large amount of data is to be handled which is yet to be processed, a system wherein hardware resources are used till the limit going a step further.
Data to be processed is divided into records or groups and multiple processing is done by using multiple processes and multiple threads.
Moving ahead, distributed processing using multiple machines is also implemented.
When resources are used upto the limit, it becomes extremely important to reduce as much as possible.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Continue the processing as much as possible (Recovery at the time of occurrence of abnormality)</dt>
<dd>
<p>When a large amount of data is to be processed, the countermeasures when an abnormality occurs in input data or system itself must be considered.<br>
A large amount of data takes a long time to finish processing, however if the time till recovery after occurrence of error is prolonged, it is likely to affect the system a great deal.<br>
For example, consider a data consisting of 1 billion records to be processed. Operation schedule would be obviously affected a great deal if error is detected in 999 millionth record and the processing so far is to be performed all over again.<br>
To control this impact, process continuity unique to batch processing becomes very important Hence a system wherein error data skipped and next data record is processed, a system to restart the process and a system which attempts
auto-recovery become necessary. Further, it is important to simplify a job as much as possible and enable its easy execution later.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Can be executed flexibly according to triggers of execution (various activation methods)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A system to respond to various execution triggers is necessary when triggered by time, or by connecting online or connecting with external system.
various systems are widely known such as synchronous processing wherein processing starts when job scheduler reaches
scheduled time, asynchronous processing wherein the process is kept resident and batch processing
is performed as per the events.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Handles various input and output interfaces (Various input output interfaces)</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is important to handle various files like CSV/XML as well as databases for linking online and external systems.
Further, if a method which transparently handles respective input and output method exists, implementation becomes easier and to deal with various formats becomes more quickly.</p>

<h2 id="Ch02_GeneralBatchProcess_Considerations"><a class="anchor" href="#Ch02_GeneralBatchProcess_Considerations"></a>Rules and precautions to be considered in batch processing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Important rules while building a batch processing system and a few considerations are shown.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simplify unit batch processing as much as possible and avoid complex logical structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep process and data in physical proximity (Save data at the location where process is executed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimise the use of system resources (especially I/O) and execute operations in in-memory as much as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, review I/O of application (SQL etc) to avoid unnecessary physical I/O.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not repeat the same process for multiple jobs.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, in case of counting and reporting process, avoid repetition of counting process during reporting process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always assume the worst situation related to data consistency. Verify data to check and to maintain consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review backups carefully. Difficulty level of backup will be high especially when system is operational seven days a week.</p>
